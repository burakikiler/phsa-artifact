# PHSA Glider theme

## Compiling CSS / JS

The PHSA Glider theme uses `gulp` to compile
SASS and JavaScript. Here's how you can get the ball rolling:

### One-time setup

  1. Install `nvm`, if it's not already installed.
  1. Navigate to the theme's directory in your console.
  1. Install and use the required version of Node by running `nvm install`.
  This has to be done only once, next time you can simply run `nvm use` to switch to the required version.
  1. Run `yarn` to download and install the theme dependencies.

### Compiling CSS / JS

First, you have to install `nvm` and `gulp` as per instructions above.

To compile the SASS & JS files of the theme, do the following:
  1. Navigate to the theme's directory in your console.
  1. Run `nvm use` to make sure that you're using the right version of Node.
  1. Run `yarn start` to compile and then watch the theme's SCSS & JS files.
